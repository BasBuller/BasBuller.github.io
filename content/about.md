I get pretty excited about everything computers, but especially AI. Have worked as an applied AI scientist at [Tractable](tractable.ai) and worked on Volvo's self driving software. Making everyone smarter and more creative while fighting complexity at [escherthink.com](eschertink.com). You'll probably find me thinking about some new idea or topic, hopefully an esoteric one.

With this website I am creating my own corner of the internet. Modern social media is pretty shit tbh. And making a website has never been easier. So instead of building my digital home on ground I would be renting, I am building it on land I do own. I recommend you do the same. Also because it is actually quite fun.

Most of what I write will be me getting my thoughts out into the world. This also means they can be unpolished and contain mistakes. If you find one I'd really appreciate it if you let me know!
