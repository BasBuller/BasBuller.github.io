I get pretty excited about everything computers. Making everyone smarter and more creative while fighting complexity at [escherthink.com](eschertink.com). You'll probably find me think a lot about some new idea or topic that preferably is not too mainstream.

With this website I am creating my own corner of the internet. Modern social media is pretty shit tbh, and making a website has never been easier. So instead of building my digital home on ground I would be renting I am building it on land I do own. I recommend you do the same, also because it is actually quite fun.
