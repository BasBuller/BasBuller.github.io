# Giving allowances sucks and giving an appreciating asset is the moral thing to do

An appreciating asset provides an opportunity of sustaining yourself. An allowance makes you dependent on the provider, locking you into a subordinate position.

<!--more-->

No matter how big the allowance, receiving an allowance implies you're a subordinate of the providing party. Think about that, and especially the perverse relationship that builds. The receiving party will become increasingly dependent on the providing party for life support since people adjust their living to their means and its origins. Socialist governments know this and leverage it. More people living off of a government allowance? Surely they'll vote for socialist governments, however bad they might be for overall wealth maintenance and creation. With wealth I refer to wealth in the wide sense of the word, so quality of life, research, health, monetary. All this does is lead to slow but progressive decline of the welfare state, leading to smaller allowances, more frustration towards the government, followed by a realisation and uprising of self sufficiency. Sadly though, self sufficiency has to be the norm and default, not a reaction to an undesirable state. 

Maybe some of this can be prevented by providing those in need of help with an appreciating asset. Something that starts to pay itself back over time and grow into more value. That gives the receiving end the potential for true freedom but also a forcing function to take care of themselves by managing the asset. This is not what gives you social votes though, but it is the way forward. I only see this becoming a reality if the appreciating asset is relatively self managing, ie a computer doing useful work in name of its owner. Then the owner receives the profits of this work.

By the way, this pattern is also taking place in the modern tech world. Subscription models and existing social media are essentially a form of allowance. Yet you don't provide your time/vote but in this case money or your data. An appreciating asset would be giving someone the opportunity to take part in a marketplace that grows and is flourishing. Like an AI system that learns from its user and acts for them on the marketplace. Now the user just pays a small fee for transacting on that marketplace while user their own assets to receive the value it creates.
