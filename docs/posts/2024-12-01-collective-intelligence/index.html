				<p>Better collaboration follows from communicating more and with precision. So let&rsquo;s increase the rate of exchange of information and our ability to interpret new information.</p>
<ul>
<li>We at Escher Think imagine a world of collaboration through faster exchange of information.
<ul>
<li>A world where great ideas are communicated at the speed of thoughtâ€”no more waiting for breakthroughs to be heard.</li>
<li>A world where collaboration can continue, even if another person is offline.</li>
<li>A world where your computer understands you and acts in your best interest.</li>
<li>A world where you get compensated for your contributions, putting you in control of the value you create.</li>
<li>A world where has a stake in our collective intelligence, sharing the benefits and responsibilities equally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In such a world amazing things will happen because the creation of knowledge and art is accelerated.
<ul>
<li>Groundbreaking research gets published the second it is done. Instead of waiting years for being accepted in academic journals.</li>
<li>Worldwide collaboration is possible as if you were in the same location.</li>
<li>Finding multiple experts on a topic is easy and requesting their help just as much.</li>
<li>We get the seamlessly work with many digital agents. Now you&rsquo;re a 1000x engineer with the help of some digital friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the reality today is far from this dream. We spend most of time on mundane information exchanges we don&rsquo;t even really control or care about
<ul>
<li>Answering the same questions ten times over</li>
<li>Waiting for a reply from an offline colleague</li>
<li>Giving away the content we create to big tech, adding to their profit</li>
<li>Engaging with a timeline that we simply do not control</li>
<li>We spend more time on low-value interactions than creating something new, let&rsquo;s change that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At Escher Think we build the following to bring us into the future:
<ul>
<li>Build systems that know what you know. Such systems can understand and help you.</li>
<li>These systems can answer increasingly more complicated questions as you would.</li>
<li>Or help you sift through data extracting information of use to you. You don&rsquo;t have to look at all the details, unless you want to of course.</li>
<li>As the symbiosis grows, so does your trust in the system. You can outsource a growing number of tasks and trust the results to match your standards.</li>
<li>It might even manage many digital agents on your behalf. The possibilities are endless.</li>
<li>You take back control over your knowledge and time. While helping others at little to no effort.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now imagine everyone having such a system. Suddenly your business, or even the entire internet, changes. Interesting and impactful ideas spread across the world at light speed. New inspiration is an arms length away. leading to groundbreaking research and the most beautiful pieces of art. And most importantly, instead of being a cog in a machine we&rsquo;re all part owner again. I&rsquo;d definitely like to live in that world.</li>
</ul>
