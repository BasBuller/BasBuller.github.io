				<p>Remaining economically relevant in the digital age requires accelerating how fast you create and communicate new information.</p>
<p>As the rate at which an asset is made or copied goes up, so does the rate of depreciation of an asset. Assets that change slowly retain their value because they barely exchange information with their environment, like diamonds. Assets that exchange essentially instantly, like bits and bytes, are worth next to nothing as soon as they&rsquo;re communicated with the world. We happen to live in a world where the (digital) rate of information exchange is always increasing. And we increasingly earn our income in the digital domain. This means that if we want to stay economically relevant we need to become faster at generating and communicating new information.</p>
<p>It seems likely to me this rate of change follows a powerlaw. Digital communication is driven by computation. The growth of available computational power follows a powerlaw. And thus it seems likely information creation and communication follows a similar trend.</p>
<p>Now, I ask myself the question what could change this trend. Either increase the rate of acceleration or slow it down. Two processes instantly come to mind, which I will describe from the perspective of slowing down the rate of acceleration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newly generated information is of lower quality, leading to the saturation of communication channels with useless information. This slows down the exchange of useful information, hence putting a larger premium on it. It retains its value better.</li>
<li>The growth in useful compute power slows down. With useful I mean compute levels that can be sustained near indefinitely. As an example, modern GPUs have a theoretical FLOPs ceiling that&rsquo;s around twice as high as their operational amount of FLOPs. This is because memory speed becomes a bottleneck in data intensive computational applications. I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail here, but will probably get back to this at a later time. Just remember that useful compute power has multiple constraints. If one does not continue to scale but the rest does the whole system will be weighed down.
The inverse of these trends also holds true, leading to an increase in the rate of acceleration.</li>
</ul>
<p>These processes also map very well onto incumbent tech companies of the 21st century and the upcoming AI companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incumbents made most of their fortune by aggregating data and selling insights extracted from this data. The monetary exchange is indirect from a consumer&rsquo;s perspective. You sell your attention and focus towards advertisements in exchange for access to the raw data collected and insights extracted from it by the tech incumbent. As long as the incumbent is the sole party with large scale access to the data it is at a massive advantage because it can extract novel insights no one else can.</li>
<li>AI companies tend to focus increasingly on the compute edge. Surely incumbents do now too. But the new AI companies leveraged their advantage of being nimble to maximally extract value from GPUs. These chips were steadily innovated on for decades, yet enterprises had no real use for them. A buffer of untapped compute power was at the disposal of startups like OpenAI.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve sketched a very binary picture of what drives value in the digital space. Obviously things are not <em>as</em> black and white. Algorithmic innovation is still the biggest potential upset. Being well connected is as powerful as ever, if not more than before due to the centralisation of capital. Simply being liked sells extremely well too. And regulatory friction, or the lack of, is definitely influential too.</p>
<p>That said, what do I think is best to focus on when trying to be significantly less dependent on bigtech, incumbents and upcoming? Especially as an individual? Quite simply, make sure your rate of acceleration of creating and communicating novel information goes up. Interestingly, individuals can have an edge over large corporations. This edge is the combination of their unique personal data and their network. Your data can be used to create insights only you can generate, because you are the only one with your personal data. And your network is more inclined to communicate with you. So spreading new information within your network is significantly easier for you than for a corporation few people still truly trust. Just make sure you share the <strong>insights gained from your data</strong>, not all the data itself. That way you essentially have an appreciating asset, your unique set of knowledge and network that only grows over time. For more on why this is an appreciating asset, stay tuned.</p>
<p>Definitely an answer that says pretty much nothing or a lot. Hopefully it does provide a framework for thinking clearly about what to optimise for to remain economically viable. Accelerating in the amount of new information you create and communicate will always pay off, as long as you&rsquo;re decently capable of distributing your product. But that likely becomes easier as you create more and more value.</p>
